Everything you need is on YouTube and therefore free. I recommend all of the following:

    Classical Mechanics - Leonard Susskind - Advanced.
    Special Relativity - Leonard Susskind - Advanced.

    I’ve listed two of Susskind’s courses above to get you started - there are many more. There are 6 core courses (Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity and Electrodynamics, General Relativity, Cosmology, Statistical Mechanics); 9 supplemental courses (Advanced Quantum Mechanics, Higgs Boson, Quantum Entanglement, Relativity, Particle Physics 1 - Basic Concepts, Particle Physics 2 - Standard Model, Particle Physics 3 - Supersymmetry and Grand Unification, String Theory) plus archive courses which are earlier versions of some of the preceding (Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity and Electrodynamics, General Relativity, Cosmology, Statistical Mechanics). You can find them all on YouTube as I stated above, or, you can get them directly from https://theoreticalminimum.com and look under “courses”.

    Mathematical Physics - Karl Bender - Graduate level.
    MIT 8.010 Classical Mechanics - Walter Lewin - Undergraduate level.
    MIT 8.020 Electricity And Magnetism - Walter Lewin - Undergraduate level.
    MIT 8.030 Vibrations and Waves - Walter Lewin - Undergraduate level.

    There are several versions of the above three courses but Lewin’s are best. Chose those over any others.

    MIT 8.286 The Early Universe - Alan Guth - Undergraduate level.
    MIT Differential Equations - Gilbert Strang - Undergraduate level.
    MIT Multivariable Calculus - Denis Auroux - Undergraduate level.
    MIT 8.04 Quantum Physics - Allan Adams - Undergraduate level.
    Sean Carroll - The Big Picture - Advanced (but very, very good). Covers *all* of modern physics.
    The W. E. Hereaus Winter School On Gravity And Light - Frederic P. Scheuller et. al.
    Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics - Frederic P. Scheuller - Advanced.
    Lectures on Quantum Theory - Also Frederic P. Scheuller - Advanced.

The lectures by Scheuller are advanced but superb. I thoroughly recommend them. All told the above will cost you about 400 to 500 hours of study and precisely zero pounds/dollars/euros etc. If you want a good set of textbooks to ease you into physics try the Feynman Lectures on Physics - Three volumes. These will cost you money; about £25 per volume. The only thing studying any/all of the above won’t get you is a degree certificate. But hey, look on the bright side, you don\t need to mortgage your house to pay for it.
